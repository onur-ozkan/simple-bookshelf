Why
---

I often need to look up details about the books I own when I am outside.
But that's not always possible because I own and read a lot of books and
it's hard to remember them all, especially if a book wasn't particularly
memorable. This page lets me store my entire library so I can quickly
search and check specific information from anywhere when I am not at home.

Usage
-----

1. Edit the `BOOKS` array in `books.js` with your collection.
2. Open (or serve) `index.html` in a browser to browse and
search your shelf anywhere online.
