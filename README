Why?
---

I often need to look up details about the books I own when I am outside.
But that's not always possible because I own and read a lot of books and
it's hard to remember them all, especially if a book wasn't particularly
memorable.

To solve this problem, I need a very simple and fast app without ads and
unnecessary features/bloat and it shouldn't require me to install an app
just to search a piece of information. The app should store book information
in a straightforward way and have a consistent and easy-to-use design, and
it should always be accessible (shouldn't get removed or deprecated) while
I am alive using it.

Usage
-----

1. Edit the `BOOKS` array in `books.js` with your collection.
2. Open (or serve) `index.html` in a browser to browse and
search your shelf anywhere online.
